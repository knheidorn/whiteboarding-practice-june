# Linked Lists

### General Notes

Linked lists are like arrays in that they can contain strings, characters and numbers,
and that they can be sorted or unsorted. The major difference is that an array can
be indexed to easily access any given value. Linked lists, however, require that you
move from the head down to the desired value rather than calling directly on it.
